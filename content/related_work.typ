Contemporary research on automated assessment and personalised feedback spans three intersecting streams. The first investigates automatic assessment systems that grade and comment on student work at scale. The second examines the recent wave of large language models (LLMs) and their capacity to generate high‑quality formative feedback. The third explores learner profiling and adaptive learning, laying the conceptual foundations for tailoring feedback to individual needs.
